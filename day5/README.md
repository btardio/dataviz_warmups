## Warm-Up Day 5

#### Exercise 1 - Welcome to Python Sign

Using for loops, ranges, variables, lists or whatever you need, create an ascii picture that looks like:

```
---*---
---*---
WELCOME
---*---
---*---
```


#### Exercise 2 - Palindrome Detection

Reverse the letters of the words racecar, gregory and rotavator.

Determine if the word is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same way backwards.


#### Exercise 3 - Valid Phone Number

For the phone numbers listed print the phone number and then print YES if it is a valid phone number or NO if it is not a valid number.

```
8181123322
310222100
3231112222
80002121222
```

#### Extra - Numerical Accuracy

If you would like to see one of the benefits of using Python, run the following code.

```python
for i in range(0,5000): print( 2**i )
```

This shows us that Python can handle really large numbers while some languages can't.
