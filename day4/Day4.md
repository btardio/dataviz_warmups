## Warm-Up 1

### Step 1

Given the Fibonacci Sequence, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number>

* populate 10 rows, labeling the column and counting the rows from 0 to 9.
* Graph the points of the set in excel.

### Step 2

Given the Triangular Number Sequence, 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number>

* Populate 10 rows, labeling the column and counting the rows from 0 to 9.
* Expand the previous graph to include the triangle number sequence.

### Step 3

* Create a third column with the average of the previous two sequences.
* Expand the previous graph to include the average of the previous two sequences.

### Step 4

* Create a regression model, best fit trend line for the average.

### Extra

* Create formulas for generating these sequence based on the previous cells and the row index.


## Extra Warm-Up

* Create a sin graph and a trend line for 0 to pi, 0 to pi/2, 0 to pi/4 and see how the exponential (and other) versions of the trend line changes as you adjust the number of rows that are graphed.

Hints:

Label your x-axis:
0, 0.785398163, 1.570796327, 2.35619449, 3.141592654, 3.926990817, 4.71238898, 5.497787144

Your first column is then sin of your x-axis labels, sin(A2)
